<p>This new Edition of the Works of David Gray, containing, it is
believed, all the maturely finished poems of the author, is a double
memorial. It commemorates “the thin-spun life” of a man of true
genius and rare promise, and the highly cultured judgment and tender
sympathies of a critic who has passed away in the vigorous fulness of
his years.</p>

<p>A specimen page of “The Luggie,” forwarded with an appreciative
letter from a friend, reached the author on the day before his death.
He received it as “good news”—the fragmentary realization of his
ambitious dreams—and, in the hope that his name might not be wholly
forgotten, said he could now enter “without tears” into his rest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Within a week before his removal from amongst us, Mr. Glassford Bell
was engaged in correcting the proofs of the present edition. He had
selected from a mass of MSS. and other material what new pieces he
thought worthy of insertion in this enlarged edition—he had rearranged
the whole and finally revised the greater part of the volume, which it
was his intention to preface with a Memoir and Criticism. He looked
forward to accomplishing this labour of love in a period of retirement
from more active work which he had proposed to pass in Italy.</p>

<p>It has been thought inadvisable to commit to other hands the
unexpectedly interrupted task. For a statement of the few and
simple vicissitudes of the Poet’s career, as well as a brief but
discriminating estimate of his rank in our literature, the reader is
referred to the speech—at the close of the volume—delivered by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
Mr. Bell, nine years ago, on the inauguration of the Monument in the
“Auld Aisle” Burying-ground. Of the movement which resulted in this
tribute to departed genius, the late Sheriff was one of the most active
promoters. Himself a poet, and a generous patron of all genuine art,
the West of Scotland has known no “larger heart” or “kindlier hand.”
There is something suggestive in the fact that his last effort was to
throw another wreath on the early tomb of David Gray.</p>

<span class="i0">In the first portion of her married life,</span>
<span class="i0">This woman, now, alas! so weary, old,</span>

<span class="i0">Behold the old man with the sunken eyes</span>
<span class="i0">And broken heart. This was his eldest-born.</span>
<span class="i0">A black-eyed boy he was, and in his youth</span>

<span class="i0">When in <i>his</i> youthful strength he would <i>him</i> shield,</span>
<span class="i0">And help him to the stone before the door</span>
<span class="i0">In summer time, when streamlets murmured clear.</span>
<span class="i0">So he grew up, but scorned the homely ways</span>
<span class="i0">Of the grey place of his nativity.</span>
<span class="i0">He saw the sun rise from behind the hills,</span>
<span class="i0">His well-thumbed book firm clasped in his young hand.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He saw it sink within the breezy glen,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the birds shrink from its burning face</span>
<span class="i0">To shade in nests, his book firm clasped in hand.</span>
<span class="i0">But most he pondered over nature’s book—</span>
<span class="i0">The bubbled rill and the green-bladed corn,</span>
<span class="i0">The lowly wild-flowers and the leafy trees</span>
<span class="i0">Alive with music. His father wondered strange,</span>
<span class="i0">And prouder grew of his bold quiet son,</span>
<span class="i0">Who spoke without restraint or lowly eye</span>
<span class="i0">Unto God’s minister. And he would tell</span>
<span class="i0">At other fire-sides of his wondrous ways,</span>
<span class="i0">The oft-trimmed lamp when others were indrawn;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor did he check the working of the mind</span>
<span class="i0">And wearing of the flesh. <i>He</i> knew no harm.</span>
<span class="i0">So time grew older still, and he went off,</span>

<span class="i0">All floating in the blue. No lark was here,</span>
<span class="i0">In love with angels, but the place was lone</span>
<span class="i0">And dark and cold. No milkmaid’s song was here,</span>

<span class="i0">His father saw him die. He never left</span>
<span class="i0">His bedside; but with eyes that seemed as glazed,</span>
<span class="i0">For ever staring at the sharpened face,</span>
<span class="i0">He stood and stood and wept not. In that time</span>
<span class="i0">His son saw heaven and chided all delay.</span>
<span class="i0">His father knew not of the words of blame</span>
<span class="i0">That blest his dying breath. He seized the clay,</span>
<span class="i0">And clutched it desperately unto his breast.</span>
<span class="i0">The arms fell down, nor gave returning press.</span>
<span class="i0">And that crush broke the doting father’s heart.</span>

<div class="chapter"><h2><a name="b17" id="b17"></a>Gray’s Monument.</h2></div>

<p>At the inauguration of the Monument erected to the Poet’s Memory in
the “Auld Aisle” Burying Ground, Kirkintilloch, July 29, 1865, Mr.
Bell said:—</p>

<p>David Gray, was born on the 29th January, 1838, and reared in his
father’s house here at Merkland till he reached his fourteenth year.
His parents, seeing as they did his disposition and his genius,
thought they might find means to bring up their son for the Church.
With that view he was sent into Glasgow, and as he required funds to
aid him in the prosecution of his studies, at that very early age he
became a pupil-teacher in the city. He contrived also to attend the
famous University there for four successive sessions. But during all
that time his mind was brimming over with poetry, which rose like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
rising tide above his Latin, above his Greek, above his theological
studies. He had a very ardent and ambitious fancy; he had high
aspirations; he had an earnest belief that he was born to be a poet,
and to attain fame. In one so young it might have been thought
that this was an overweening conception of his own powers. But in
reality it was not. A poet is also a <i>vates</i> or prophet, and there
is no reason why he should not be permitted sometimes to prophesy
of himself. David Gray prophesied of himself that his name would
yet be known to his fellow-countrymen as a poet and a teacher, for
every true poet is a true teacher. In May, 1860, when he had so far
completed his studies in Glasgow, and had arrived at the age of
nearly 22, he started alone for London. He had read of the great
literary world of the metropolis, and he was fired with an ambition
to mingle in it and to make himself, if possible, known to some
of the men there. He was fortunate in forming the acquaintance,
very soon after going to London, of Mr. Monckton Milnes, now Lord
Houghton, who at once formed a correct appreciation of the poet’s
character and genius. Lord Houghton has himself put it upon record
that he found in David Gray what appeared to him to be the making
of a great man. He has also recorded of him that upon first seeing
him he was strongly reminded of the poet Shelley. Gray had a light,
well-built form; he had a full brow and an out-looking eye; and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
had a sensitive, melancholy mouth. So Lord Houghton speaks of him.
He formed also in London other acquaintances of value, including Mr.
Oliphant, then Private Secretary to Lord Elgin, now member for the
Stirling Burghs. As to Sydney Dobell, the poet, I do not know that
he actually formed the personal acquaintance of that gentleman; but
he had frequent correspondence with Mr. Dobell, and received from
him valuable letters, and suggestions, and assistance. He formed the
acquaintance of a very estimable woman—Miss Marian James—herself
an authoress of great reputation. Nearer at home he had already
attained the friendly companionship of some whom he valued much. I
am delighted to see two of those gentlemen present to-night—Mr. W.
Freeland, David Gray’s early and attached friend, now of the <i>Herald</i>
Office, Glasgow, and Mr. James Hedderwick, himself a poet and an
editor of great reputation. He had not, however, been long in London
till he was seized with a cold which rapidly assumed the character of
consumption. Lord Houghton and others, feeling deeply interested in
him, got him sent to the South of England for a time; but the disease
making rapid progress, David Gray was seized with an irresistible
home-sickness, and notwithstanding all the kindness, and all the
attention of his friends in the South, in January, 1861, he made his
re-appearance at his father’s house down there in Merkland. He lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
there from January, 1861, to the 3d December of the same year, when
he died. That is the brief record of this young poet’s life—almost
all the incidents in it, all the events connected with it. But who
can record, or who shall attempt to record the thousand thoughts and
emotions that passed through his mind, that illuminated his fancy,
and that kindled his genius? Who shall say how these familiar woods,
and fields, and glens, and streams were to him dearer, a thousand
times dearer and more romantic, than any woods, or fields, or glens,
or streams in any other part of the world. No man but a true poet
has that warm affection for home scenes, for his country, for his
native land, for the friends of his youth; no man but a true poet has
those sentiments in their height and in their depth; and if ever a
man entertained them, the poetical remains of David Gray prove that
he had them in a deep, pathetic, and most earnest manner. Upon his
death-bed, within three days of his death, he received what appears
to me to be a particularly beautiful letter from Marian James,
breathing that <i>alma gentile</i> which none but a refined and pure woman
possesses. I never saw David Gray, but I have seen to-night the
humble room in which he was born; I have seen the home in which he
was afterwards reared—a simple, rural house, belonging to a simple,
honest, and upright family, such a family as Scotland is always proud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of—and of such families I am proud to know that Scotland possesses
her thousands and tens of thousands. I saw his mother to-night, and
was deeply impressed with the apparent simplicity and earnestness
of her character. I owe her my gratitude and my thanks for her
presenting me with a book which belonged to her son, and which
contains many of his private markings. I shall always retain it
as a valuable and most esteemed possession. David Gray’s poetical
susceptibility was of the most conspicuous description. He had a
most refined perception of the beautiful; he had a perception of
an interminable vista of beauty and truth. He had noble and pure
thoughts, and he has been enabled to express those noble and pure
thoughts in very noble and pure language. “The Luggie” is a most
remarkable poem, containing many very fine passages, inspired
partially, no doubt, by a careful perusal of Thomson’s “Seasons”
and Wordsworth’s “Excursion,” and not, therefore, so entirely
original as some of the author’s subsequent poems; but with passages
breaking out in it every now and then which neither Thomson nor
Wordsworth suggested, and which are entirely the conceptions of
David Gray’s own genius. “The Luggie,” as has been well said, “may
not possess in itself much to attract the painter’s eye, but it has
sufficed for a poet’s love.” The series of sonnets entitled “In the
Shadows”—written by the poet during his last illness—many of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
bearing relation to his own condition, his own life, and his own
prospects—appear to me to possess a solemn beauty not surpassed by
many of the finest passages in Tennyson’s “In Memoriam,” totally
distinct and unlike the “In Memoriam,” but as genuine, as sincere,
as heart-stirring, and often as poetical. In the author’s own words,
they admit you “to the chancel of a dying poet’s mind;” you feel
when you are reading these sonnets that they are written in the
sure and immediate prospect of death; but they contain thoughts
about life, about the past, and about the future, most powerful
and most beautiful. I am not going to ask you to take all this for
granted. I think, upon an occasion like this, we ought to show some
little reason for the faith that is in us; and, if it will not
fatigue you too much, I propose in a few minutes to read two or
three of those passages and those sonnets which strike me as worthy
of all admiration. I feel confident that these works are destined
to take their place amongst standard poetical works in the library
of every man of literary taste. We are here, as you have said,
upon the occasion of the erection of a monument to David Gray—a
monument erected on the spot where he is buried, in a beautiful old
churchyard, standing upon the brow of a hill, from which a fine and
extensive view of the surrounding valley and hills is commanded. It
is a granite monument, and will last, I hope, for centuries. I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
sure that in this neighbourhood it will often be visited by persons
who feel something like kindred emotions with David Gray, and they
will be proud of this neighbourhood that it gave birth in that
humble cottage to a man who has added so much charm to its natural
scenery. It was felt at the same time, I believe, by the gentlemen in
Glasgow who took the principal charge of it, that a great or imposing
monument was not the thing that was wanted. A plain, simple, enduring
record of respect and esteem was what was wished. Therefore, although
the fund I know could have been trebled, quadrupled, with ease, it
was thought that when a certain moderate sum was obtained that was
enough, and by the aid of the genius of our townsman, Mr. Mossman, I
venture to say that an appropriate and suitable monument has now been
erected on that spot. I may mention that I find the names in the list
of subscribers very varied. Among the Glasgow subscribers I find the
name of Mrs. Nichol, widow of the late Professor of Astronomy in our
University, who I know took a great interest in David Gray from first
to last, and who, I know also, with her usual benevolence, aided in
smoothing his dying pillow. I find the name of William Logan, one of
the most earnest and attached friends that David Gray ever had; I
find Lord Houghton; I find Mr. Bailie Cochrane; I find Mr. Stirling
of Keir, the Hon. Julia Fane, the Dowager Duchess of Sutherland, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Macmillan, Mr. MacLehose, Mr. J. A. Campbell, Mr. Hutton, editor of
the London <i>Spectator</i>, and many other names. Now Lord Houghton was
requested to write an appropriate inscription for this monument. I
know it was a labour of love with him, and I know he was anxious to
write such an epitaph as would be thought suitable both here and
elsewhere; and I venture to say, and I hope you will agree with me,
that he has admirably succeeded in the simplicity and truth of that
epitaph which has now been engraved on the monument. Such is the
young man whose fame we shall not willingly let die, because they
who read his works aright derive moral improvement and intellectual
benefit from them—because, young as he was when he died, he
cherished pure and noble thoughts, and because he has left those pure
and noble thoughts as a record to us of his life, and as an incentive
to us to endeavour to cherish similar thoughts. Therefore, we owe
him a debt of gratitude; and, therefore, without attempting to raise
him upon a pinnacle too high—for his life was cut short before the
highest aims of his ambition were attained—let it go forth that no
true poet in this land, be his position in life what it may, be his
birth humble or great—no true poet, no great teacher of the hearts
of men, will ever find an ungrateful country in Scotland, as long as
it remembers its great poets—as long as it knows that it is the land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of Burns. In “The Luggie,” which you are aware is a descriptive and
pastoral poem, there are varied moods of thought. There is a good
deal of mere description of beautiful scenery, but that, whilst
exquisitely done, is also intermingled with many thoughts and
feelings which add a richness to the charm of the poet’s description.
No mere description of external and lifeless nature, unless brought
home to the heart by allusions to human emotion, can ever produce a
very strong effect. But David Gray seems to have understood admirably
how to combine those two qualities in his descriptive picture, and
whilst he describes beautiful external nature, he always takes care
at the same time to attract and touch the feelings. I am happy to
know that David Gray died in true Christian faith, and amity with all
men. I know from the esteemed clergyman who attended him weekly for
many a day, that he had those true Christian sentiments which become
a man, and most of all become a great man, upon his death-bed. I
have had the very greatest satisfaction in being present to-night. I
felt it to be an honour to be requested to come here and express my
sentiments on such a subject. It is an honour which I feel, and it is
a pleasure which I feel still more, for when a man has passed through
this world now for a good many years, as I have done, there can be
nothing dearer to his heart than expressing sympathy with the great
and good, and feeling those expressions of sympathy reflected from
the hearts and the eyes of a sympathising audience.

a place where the casual curlew is his only companion, and a startled
grouse-cock the only creature that can regard him with enmity or
suspicion. The silence of moorland nature has worked into his soul,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
